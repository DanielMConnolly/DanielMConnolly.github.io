    <h1 class='text-center'> Hi, I'm Daniel! </h1>
    <p>
      I am a computer science major at the University at Buffalo, currently in my junior year. I have lived in Bethlehem, a town just outside of Albany, NY, for almost my entire life. I aspire to be a software engineer after I recieve my bachelor's degree.
      In the meantime, I look forward to pursuing as many internships as I can. I am interested in several other fields as well, including economics and physics, and I hope to spend some time learning and even working in those fields as well. In the
      future, I hope to start a business, using my skills in the field of technology as well as my interests in economics and start-up culture.
