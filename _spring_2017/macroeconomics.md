This was a basic econ class, fairly straightforward. I learned a lot about how currency actually works. I understood concepts like inflation and unemployment to some degree, but after taking this class, I have a much better understanding about how those types of thinks work and relate. I want to take more Econ, but I'm not sure time will permit.
