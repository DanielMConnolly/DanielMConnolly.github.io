<h1> Skills and Interests</h1>
<div class="text">
<h2> Programming </h2>
<h3> Java </h3>
<p>I have been learning Java for the past few months, and although I cannot claim to be completely proficient in it yet, I have made great progress.
I am currently working on a program that will solve physics problems when a user inputs data. </p>
<h3> HTML and CSS </h3>

<p>After hours of Khan Academy and Dash General Assembly, I have at least acquired the skills to create this website. There will be many more hours to come. Web 
development is a lot of fun, and the more work you put in, the better your final product will be.</p>
<h2>Clarinet </h2>
<p>I have been playing the clarinet for 8 years. I played in band all through-out middle school and high school. I hope to find an ensemble of some kind
at UB, time-permitting.</p>


<h2>Public Speaking </h2> 
<p>Although I get as nervous as the next person, I like talking in front of people. I participated in debate in High School, and am now in debate society.
I like to argue and persuade, and pride myself on my ability to do so.</p>
