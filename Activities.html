<h2><u>Politics</u></h2>
<p>I am very interested in politics and would definitely enjoy a career in public service. I think coming into politics with a degree in applied sciences would bring a 
fresh perspective to the table. Too many politicians only have a law background, and I think our government needs to be more intellectually diverse. </p>

<h3>College Republicans.</h3>
<p>In order to meet people with a similar interest in politics, I joined the College Republicans. We discuss current issues and occasionally assist local 
Republicans in their quest to get in office.</p>

<h2><u> Debate Society</u></h2>
<p> Debate society has been very helpful in improving my public speaking skills and debating ability. So far, I debated the merits of the death penalty 
and the second amendment. Debate Society is especially helpful because people give you constructive feedback after you debate.</p>

<h2> <u>Public Speaking </u></h2> 
<p> Although I get as nervous as the next person, I like talking in front of people. I participated in debate in High School, and am now in debate society.
I like to argue and persuade, and pride myself on my ability to do so. </p>

<h2><u>Computer Science</u></h2>
<p> I love computer science, otherwise I wouldn't be majoring in it. I participated in UB's hackathon this semester, which was very exciting because it really
opened my eyes to what a Computer Scientist was capable of in even a short period of time. I attended a few of UB's ACM meetings, but I had a conflict. I plan
to be more active in ACM next sememster. In the meantime, I look forward to learning more about coding.</p>
